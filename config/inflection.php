 * Irregular words array to be used with the Inflection class.
 *
 * Although the Inflection class already contains numerous references to word 
 * formulation rulesets, there are still going to be those fringe cases to which 
 * the rules do not apply. This array serves as a container for these special 
 * inflection-related relationships. You only need to specify a one-way relationship
 * as it will simply be reversed when the reciprocal version is required. 
 *
 * @example: 
 *
 *	'irregular' => array(
 *
 *		'singular' => 'plural'
 *
 *	),
 *
 *	'splitwords' => array(
 *
 *		'contenteditors' => 'content editors'
